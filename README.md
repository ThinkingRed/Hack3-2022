# Hack3-2022
Project Shan Tang, Abhishikth Chillara, Vishu Agarwal and I made for Hack 3 2022 - lighting calculator for aquaria.

This project has a couple parts. Firstly, the HTML, CSS, JS bit which works together to make a website where users can input their current set up to figure out what plants would go well in their current tank. It requires users to input the height of their tank and light they use. In the future, we hoped to also be able to find plants that were capadible with the fish the client wishes to raise in the tank as well.

The site could also have a mobile app which can alert the user on how to properly care for their aquatic plants. 

There is also a python verision where it prompts you directly and can suggest using an API call to an airtable. This is the form we wished would've worked with the website but couldn't get it to work in time. In the future this would allow for more efficient usablity.
